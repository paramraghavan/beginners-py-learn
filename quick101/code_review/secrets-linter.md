Here are some of the python libraries specifically designed to detect secrets, API keys, passwords, and other
sensitive information in code:

## Popular Secret Detection Libraries

**bandit** - A security linter for Python code that includes secret detection among other security checks:

```bash
pip install bandit
bandit -r your_project/
```

**semgrep** - A static analysis tool with built-in rules for secret detection:

```bash
pip install semgrep
semgrep --config=auto your_project/
```

**detect-secrets** - Yelp's library specifically focused on preventing secrets from entering your codebase:

```bash
pip install detect-secrets
detect-secrets scan --all-files .
```

**truffleHog** - Popular tool for finding secrets in git repositories:

```bash
pip install truffleHog
truffleHog --regex --entropy=False .
```

**gitleaks** - While primarily a Go tool, it has Python bindings and is very effective:

```bash
# Install via pip or use as standalone binary
pip install gitleaks
```

## Recommended Approach

For Python-specific linting, **detect-secrets** is often the best choice because it:

- Has low false positives
- Integrates well with pre-commit hooks
- Allows you to baseline existing secrets
- Supports custom plugins for different secret types

You can also combine multiple tools - for example, use **bandit** for general security issues and **detect-secrets**
specifically for secret detection.

Most of these tools can detect hardcoded passwords, API keys, AWS access keys, database connection strings, presigned
URLs, and other common patterns of leaked secrets.
