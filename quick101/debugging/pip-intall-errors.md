Troubleshooting steps to resolve pip install issues with your private repository:

## Check Your Command Syntax

First, verify you're using the correct pip install syntax:

```bash
pip install library==1.0.0
```

Note the double equals (`==`) not single (`=`).

## Verify Repository Access

- **Authentication**: Ensure you're properly authenticated to access your private repo
- **Network connectivity**: Test if you can reach the repository URL
- **Permissions**: Confirm your account has read access to the specific package

## Check Repository Configuration

```bash
# View your configured repositories
pip config list

# Check if your private repo is properly configured
pip config get global.index-url
pip config get global.extra-index-url
```

## Common Installation Methods for Private Repos

**Option 1: Using index URL**

```bash
pip install --index-url https://your-private-repo-url library==1.0.0
```

**Option 2: Using extra index URL**

```bash
pip install --extra-index-url https://your-private-repo-url library==1.0.0
```

**Option 3: Direct installation from URL**

```bash
pip install https://your-private-repo-url/library-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

## Debug Information Gathering

Run with verbose output to see detailed error information:

```bash
pip install library==1.0.0 -v
```

## Check Package Availability

Verify the package exists and is accessible:

```bash
pip search library
# or
pip index versions library
```

**SSL Errors**
SSL errors are common when working with private repositories. Here are the specific troubleshooting steps:

## Quick SSL Fixes

**Option 1: Upgrade certificates**

```bash
pip install --upgrade certifi
```

**Option 2: Use trusted host (temporary fix)**

```bash
pip install --trusted-host your-private-repo-domain library==1.0.0
```

**Option 3: Disable SSL verification (not recommended for production)**

```bash
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org library==1.0.0
```

## Corporate Network Issues

If you're behind a corporate firewall:

**Check proxy settings:**

```bash
pip install --proxy https://user:password@proxyserver:port library==1.0.0
```

**Or configure pip permanently:**

```bash
pip config set global.proxy https://user:password@proxyserver:port
```

## Certificate-Specific Solutions

**Update pip and certificates:**

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade requests[security]
```

**For macOS with outdated certificates:**

```bash
/Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command
```

## Repository-Specific SSL Configuration

**If your private repo uses self-signed certificates:**

```bash
pip config set global.cert /path/to/certificate.pem
```

**For internal certificate authority:**

```bash
pip install --cert /path/to/ca-bundle.crt library==1.0.0
```

## Test SSL Connection

```bash
python -c "import ssl; print(ssl.get_default_verify_paths())"
```
