# Tuples:
 - Immutable 
 - Ordered. Once a tuple is created, you cannot add items to it. Tuples are unchangeable.
 - Are faster than lists.

### How to Create
```
Create tuples with round brackets.
     t = ('a','b','c','a')
     t= () #Empty Tuple
Tuple containing single element â€“ Put a comma after the first element.
       t =(10,).
Like lists, tuples can also be sliced, concatenated and membership.

Methods dir():
t=(1,2,3,4,5,1)
count() -->Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
t.count(1) #2

index() -->Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
t.index(3)
```
