# Python parse yaml

## Python parse yaml - map each layer into  a matrix 

- Install the pyyaml library: If you haven't already installed it, you can do so using pip:
```python
pip install pyyaml
```

- Read and parse the YAML file: Load the contents of the YAML file using pyyaml
- Create matrices or adjacency matrices: Depending on the structure of your YAML file, you can create matrices or adjacency matrices for each layer.
- sample example
```yaml
layer1:
  - [0, 1, 0]
  - [1, 0, 1]
  - [0, 1, 0]

layer2:
  - [1, 0, 1, 0]
  - [0, 1, 0, 1]
  - [1, 0, 1, 0]
  - [0, 1, 0, 1]

layer3:
  - [0, 0, 1]
  - [0, 1, 0]
  - [1, 0, 0]

```


## Python parse yaml  config  with sql and expressions - map each layer into  a matrix

To parse a YAML configuration with SQL and expressions and map each layer into a matrix, you'll need to use Python
libraries such as PyYAML for parsing YAML files, pandas for handling data in matrix form, and possibly sqlalchemy for
executing SQL queries.

```bash
# A connection to the database is established using sqlalchemy. 
pip install pyyaml pandas sqlalchemy
```
