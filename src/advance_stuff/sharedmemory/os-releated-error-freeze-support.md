The error you're encountering is related to how multiprocessing works on different operating systems, particularly on
Windows. It seems you might be running this on a Windows system or in an environment that doesn't use fork to start
child processes (like when using PyInstaller to create executables).

To resolve this issue, you need to add the `freeze_support()` function call and ensure that the code creating the
`Manager` is inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block. Here's how you can modify your script:

```python
from multiprocessing import Manager, freeze_support
import time


def get_shared_dict():
    return global_file_status_map


def add_file_status(file_status_map, filename, status):
    file_status_map[filename] = {'filename': filename, 'status': status}


def update_file_status(file_status_map, filename, status):
    if filename in file_status_map:
        file_status_map[filename]['status'] = status
    else:
        file_status_map[filename] = {'filename': filename, 'status': status}


def get_file_status(file_status_map, filename):
    return file_status_map.get(filename, {}).get('status', 'unknown')


def print_complete_status(file_status_map):
    print(80 * '*')
    for key, value in file_status_map.items():
        print(f"Filename: {key}, Status: {value['status']}")
    print(80 * '*')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    freeze_support()  # Add this line
    manager = Manager()
    global_file_status_map = manager.dict()

    shared_tasks = get_shared_dict()

    # Initialize with some tasks
    add_file_status(shared_tasks, '1', "open")
    add_file_status(shared_tasks, '2', "open")

    get_file_status(shared_tasks, '1')
    print_complete_status(shared_tasks)
    # Keep the script running to allow other scripts to connect
    print("\nShared task manager is running. Press Ctrl+C to exit.")
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(5)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nShared task manager stopped.")
```

The key changes are:

1. Import `freeze_support` from multiprocessing.
2. Add `freeze_support()` at the beginning of the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
3. Move the creation of `Manager()` and `global_file_status_map` inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.

These changes should resolve the error you're seeing. The `freeze_support()` function is particularly important if you
ever plan to create a frozen executable of your script (using tools like PyInstaller), but it's a good practice to
include it anyway.

Also, note that with this change, `global_file_status_map` is no longer truly global. You might need to adjust your
`get_shared_dict()` function to return this dictionary. One way to do this would be to use a global variable to store
the shared dictionary:

```python
shared_dict = None


def get_shared_dict():
    global shared_dict
    return shared_dict


if __name__ == "__main__":
    freeze_support()
    manager = Manager()
    shared_dict = manager.dict()
    # ... rest of your code ...
```

This approach ensures that `get_shared_dict()` always returns the correct shared dictionary, even when it's created
inside the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
