Let me explain `threading.Event()` in detail.

`threading.Event()` is a synchronization primitive in Python's threading module that provides a simple way for threads
to communicate with each other. Think of it like a flag that can be set or cleared - threads can wait for this flag to
be set before proceeding.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Basic Properties:

```python
# Creating an event
event = threading.Event()

# Main operations
event.set()  # Sets the flag to True
event.clear()  # Sets the flag to False
event.is_set()  # Returns True if flag is set, False otherwise
event.wait()  # Blocks until the flag is True
```

2. Real-world example of how it works:

```python
import threading
import time


def worker(event):
    print("Worker: Waiting for signal to start...")
    event.wait()  # Block until event is set
    print("Worker: Received signal, starting work!")


def manager(event):
    print("Manager: Preparing work...")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate preparation
    print("Manager: Signaling worker to start")
    event.set()  # Set the event, allowing worker to proceed


# Create the event
start_event = threading.Event()

# Create and start threads
worker_thread = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(start_event,))
manager_thread = threading.Thread(target=manager, args=(start_event,))

worker_thread.start()
manager_thread.start()

# Output:
# Worker: Waiting for signal to start...
# Manager: Preparing work...
# Manager: Signaling worker to start
# Worker: Received signal, starting work!
```
