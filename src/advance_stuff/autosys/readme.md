AutoSys is a job scheduling and workload automation system primarily used in enterprise environments to automate,
monitor, and manage batch processing tasks and workflows. It was originally developed by AutoSys Software, later
acquired by Computer Associates (now Broadcom).

Key features of AutoSys include:

1. Job scheduling and automation: AutoSys allows organizations to schedule and automate batch jobs, scripts, and
   processes across multiple platforms.

2. Dependencies management: It can handle complex job dependencies, where one job must complete before another begins.

3. Calendar-based scheduling: Jobs can be scheduled based on specific dates, times, or custom calendars.

4. Event-based triggers: Jobs can be triggered based on events such as file arrivals, database conditions, or completion
   of other jobs.

5. Monitoring and alerting: AutoSys provides real-time monitoring of job status and can send alerts for failures or
   delays.

6. Cross-platform support: It works across various operating systems including Unix, Linux, and Windows.

AutoSys is commonly used in financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, and other industries where reliable
batch processing and job scheduling are critical for business operations.

The system uses a client-server architecture with a central database that stores job definitions and statuses, and
multiple client components that interact with this database to schedule and manage jobs. The client/agent component is
installed on the client servers/machines which it needs to  control or monitor
