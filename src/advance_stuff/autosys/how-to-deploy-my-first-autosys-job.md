Here's a step-by-step guide:

First, let's create a shell script that will check if the process is running and start it if needed:

Now, let's create the AutoSys job definition:

## Steps to Implement

1. **Make the monitoring script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/check_job_monitor.sh
   ```

2. **Customize the scripts**:
    - In `check_job_monitor.sh`, replace `/path/to/job_monitor` with the actual path to your job_monitor executable.
    - Adjust the log file path as needed.
    - In the JIL file, replace `username` with your AutoSys username, `hostname` with your machine's hostname, and
      update all paths.
    - Set `n` to your desired interval in minutes (e.g., 5 for every 5 minutes).

3. **Register the job using the jil command**:
   ```bash
   jil < job_monitor_check.jil
   ```

4. **Verify the job was created successfully**:
   ```bash
   autorep -J check_job_monitor -q
   ```

5. **Start the job if it's not already running**:
   ```bash
   sendevent -E FORCE_STARTJOB -J check_job_monitor
   ```

## Additional Tips

- **To modify the job later**:
  ```bash
  update_job: check_job_monitor
  cycle_frequency: 10  /* Change to a different interval */
  ```

- **To check job status**:
  ```bash
  autorep -J check_job_monitor -d
  ```

- **To view job logs**:
  ```bash
  autosyslog -J check_job_monitor
  ```

- **If you need to delete the job**:
  ```bash
  delete_job: check_job_monitor
  ```

- **To put the job on hold**:
  ```bash
  sendevent -E JOB_ON_HOLD -J check_job_monitor
  ```

> Make sure your AutoSys environment variables are properly set up before running these commands. The most important
> environment variables are `$AUTOSYS`, `$AUTOUSER`, and `$AUTOSERV`.

## permission: gx,ge,wx in detail

The `permission: gx,ge,wx` line in the AutoSys JIL (Job Information Language) file defines the execution permissions for
the job. This setting controls who can view, execute, and modify the job within the AutoSys environment.

These permission codes follow a specific pattern:

1. The first character (`g` or `o`) specifies the permission group:
    - `g` = group permissions (users in the same group as the job owner)
    - `o` = other permissions (all other users besides the owner and group)

2. The second character specifies the type of permission:
    - `x` = execute permission (ability to run the job)
    - `e` = edit permission (ability to modify the job definition)
    - `w` = write permission (ability to update job status)
    - `r` = read permission (ability to view job definition and status)

So breaking down `gx,ge,wx`:

- `gx` = Group Execute: Users in the same group as the job owner can execute (run) the job.
- `ge` = Group Edit: Users in the same group can edit (modify) the job definition.
- `wx` = World Execute: All other users (not the owner or in the owner's group) can execute the job.

What's missing from this permission string:

- There's no `gr` or `or`, meaning there are no explicit read permissions specified.
- There's no `ow` or `oe`, meaning other users cannot edit or write to the job.

By default, the owner of the job typically has all permissions (read, write, edit, execute) without needing to specify
them explicitly.

If you wanted to add additional permissions, you could modify it to something like:

```
permission: gx,ge,wx,gr,ow,or
```

This would add group read (`gr`), other write (`ow`), and other read (`or`) permissions.
