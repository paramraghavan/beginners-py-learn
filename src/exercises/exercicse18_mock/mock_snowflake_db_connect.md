To create a mock DataSourceSetting for Snowflake, we'll need to simulate the properties typically required for a
Snowflake connection. Let's create a simple mock object that represents these settings.

```python
class MockSnowflakeDataSourceSetting:
    def __init__(self, account, warehouse, database, schema, username, password, role=None):
        self.account = account
        self.warehouse = warehouse
        self.database = database
        self.schema = schema
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.role = role

    def get_connection_string(self):
        conn_string = f"snowflake://{self.username}:{self.password}@{self.account}/{self.database}/{self.schema}?warehouse={self.warehouse}"
        if self.role:
            conn_string += f"&role={self.role}"
        return conn_string


# Example usage
mock_settings = MockSnowflakeDataSourceSetting(
    account="xy12345.us-east-1",
    warehouse="COMPUTE_WH",
    database="MYDB",
    schema="PUBLIC",
    username="myuser",
    password="mypassword",
    role="ANALYST_ROLE"
)

# Print the connection string
print(mock_settings.get_connection_string())

```

This mock `MockSnowflakeDataSourceSetting` class includes the essential properties for a Snowflake connection:

1. `account`: The Snowflake account identifier
2. `warehouse`: The name of the warehouse to use
3. `database`: The name of the database to connect to
4. `schema`: The schema within the database
5. `username`: The username for authentication
6. `password`: The password for authentication
7. `role` (optional): The role to assume after connection

The class also includes a `get_connection_string()` method that generates a connection string using these properties.
This can be useful for testing or simulating how the connection string would be constructed.

To use this mock, you can create an instance with sample data as shown in the example usage. You can then access the
properties or use the `get_connection_string()` method as needed in your tests or development environment.

Remember that this is a simplified mock. In a real-world scenario, you might need to add more properties or methods
depending on your specific use case and the full requirements of your DataSourceSetting interface.

Would you like me to explain any part of this mock object in more detail or show how to use it in a test scenario?
