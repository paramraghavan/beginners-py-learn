Write a python program, ftpmon, which continously runs and  checks  SFTP server every five minutes and gets a list of files
with date time which got copied over into the SFTP server, so when the job runs at 11.oo am, it gets a list of files that
got into SFTP server after 10.55 am and before 11.00 am. If the ftpmon crashes or fails email to  comma separated email addresses of  team lead

When we get a list to files at the 5 min interval run, then we create parent job id and add  the files  to list to  the
parent_job_map add parent job_id as key and list files as values There is a concept of batch window  if the batch window is
five mins, then all the files within that time windows get assigend to the same parent job id.
For example:
- From 10.55 to 11.00 we have 2 files, one file at 10.57  and another one at 10.58, so the batch windows starts at 10.57 am
- From 11.00 - 11.05 wre have 2 files , one file at 11.01 and another one at 11.03
- The files at time 10.57, 10.58 and 11.01 all get assigned the same parent job id
 - But file at 11.03 gets assigned a new parent job id

Run a mock ftp server
 - send files to this FTP server at random times in a batch of 2 -5 files in  window of  5 minutes -
 - between 57th minute to 2nd min of next hour or between 10th and 15th minute of  same hour .
 - These files should be  saved  in a hash using a api/function call - create, read, update
 - with key as filename and  values - filename, status
  - when file  added to sftp add a key/value to the hashmap , key as file name and value as  a row with status open
   - it can be queried back to get status - open, error, complete
   - and updated with status of complete

As the monitor runs, at every 5 min interval it make sure to test SFTP connectivity,
 - on error log error and to comma separated  email addresses of team leads
 - to add more error logs as needed
