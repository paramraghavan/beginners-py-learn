i have python venev with existing python libraries. I need to install a new set of packages. How do i find out the right
version of new set of packages which will be be compatible with the existing python libraries.
i can do a pip list and create a file for existing_packages, and i share a list of new packages, also share the global
index url
How do i find the right version of new packages to install and if need be update the version of the existing installed
packages so we have all the existing packges and new packages that can coexist.
