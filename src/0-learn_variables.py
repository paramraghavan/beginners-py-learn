int is short for integer. 1 and 2 are integers.
float is short for floating point number. 1.0 and 3.14 are floats.
str is short for string. "hello" and 'hello' are strings. It doesn't matter if you use 'single quotes' or "double quotes", they do the same thing in Python.

What happens if you use + between two strings, like "hello" + "world"? How about "hello" * "world"?
What happens if you use + between a string and an integer, like "hello" + 3? How about "hello" * 3?
What happens if you use + between a float and an integer, like 0.5 + 3? How about 0.5 * 3?

'''
Natural languages are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. 
They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); 
they evolved naturally.

Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. 
For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly
good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal 
language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:

Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.

'''
Languages can be - interpreted, compiled or run-time compiled. 
Interpreted: Python is an example of this. It processes a program line by line. As an example, 
if in a 10 line program, line 3 has a problem, then the program will run line one and line two,
then fail at line 3.

Compiled: c/c++ is an example of this. It will compile the entire program and if there is a single 
compile failure anywhere it will not run the entire code.

Bytecode compiled:  Java compiles it's program into byte code, when the program runs the java's 
JIT (just in time byte code compiler) compiler will compile  code and optimize 
the code as the program is running/executing.

How to declare a variable in Python
Python is a dynamic-typed language, which means we don't need to mention the variable type** 
or declare before using it - unlike Java or C . It makes Python the most efficient and easy to use language. 
Every variable is treated as an object in Python.

**Note
 we can optionally define variable types, but think can be used by some lint checked or ide only.
 see here for more details src/advance_stuff/type_defination/typedef.py
  
Before declaring a variable, we must follow the given rules.

The first character of the variable can be an alphabet or (_) underscore.
Special characters (@, #, %, ^, &, *) should not be used in variable name.
Variable names are case sensitive. For example - age and AGE are two different variables.
Reserve words cannot be declared as variables.

# Built-in classes use lowercase names (like str instead of Str)
# because they are faster to type, but use CapsWord names for your classes.

# How about "hello" * 3 ??

# Arithmetic operators +, *, / and more
